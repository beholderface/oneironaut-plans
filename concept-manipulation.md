# Concept Manipulation

A way to apply special effects to yourself and your entity reference using the properties of the deep noosphere.

"It seems that this place is metaphysically linked to the fundamental concepts underpinning reality. While most of these concepts are essentially immutable, I can perform certain limited modifications on _my own_ concept."

Effects are applied using a multiblock structure you build in the DN. There is a core block you write your truename to, which has two faces designated as "sockets" which you can place special modifier blocks onto. These blocks contain the effects which get applied to you/your reference. There are also extension blocks which have additional sockets (and are very expensive).

Activating the structure costs a large amount of media, which is calculated by adding up the base costs of your chosen modifiers, and then multiplied based on how many total modifiers you are applying. You cannot have more than one of these structures active at once, as activating one overwrites any existing modifiers.

In addition to their base costs, some particularly-powerful modifiers will attempt to erode the structure's core when their effects trigger, which can be is counteracted by the same shield that protects from passive DN erosion.

If the structure is broken, all of its modifiers are instantly removed. Additionally, if someone finds your structure, they can potentially apply malicious modifiers.

Some possible modifiers:
- Make your reference falsy
- Make your reference always or never equal to what it is compared to
- Make you permanently immune to deep noosphere erosion (note that the structure itself is not immune, so you do have to protect it)
- Make your reference have a chance to produce garbage iotas adjacent to itself on the stack when held by someone else
- Increase the stack size of your reference
- Increase or decrease your hex grid size
- Various other attribute modifiers (both positive and negative)
- Block overcasting
- Enable keepinventory for you (erodes core)
- Act as a totem of undying (erodes core quite a bit)
