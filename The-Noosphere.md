# The Noosphere
A transcendent realm of thought and dream, inorexably linked to the cognition of all sentient beings. Wandering wisps can occasionally be sighted here.

Player ambit is increased to 64 blocks in radius while in the noosphere, and wisps have their upkeep cost reduced to zero.

The physical structure of the noosphere is largely composed of sparse islands floating in a mysterious fluid which gets denser the deeper you go, eventually becoming the dimension's bedrock equivalent. The bedrock-oid block can be broken by targeting it with a block breaking hex, but it has extreme hardness and takes a very long time to mine otherwise. Falling into the void below the noosphere sends a player to their spawn point. Most non-player entities cannot fall very far due to the simplicity of their minds, and receive Levitation for one second, every second, when they are below y-64 in the noosphere.

Slipway geodes in the Overworld correspond to gateways in the noetic ocean, which you can use as an emergency escape route back to the Overworld if you are stuck in the noosphere.
