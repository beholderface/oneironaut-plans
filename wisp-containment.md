# Wisp Lantern
A decorative block, larger than a vanilla lantern, that emits light level 15 and contains rainbow wisp particles. Crafting recipe produces an empty one, must be energized by rclicking it on any wisp (only consumes the wisp if it's a wandering wisp).

# Wisp Battery (working title)
Can be placed on the ground and have its mode toggled with rclick or redstone. While in mode A, any wandering wisps that make contact with it are consumed to fill its internal media reservoir. In mode B, it releases wandering wisps using its media. Crafting recipe includes a phial, and the size of jar's reservoir is equal to the phial's capacity.
