# Transformation

You become a hex lich (not going to be the final title) by replacing much of your flesh with condensed media, similar to how allays are described in the book entries on quenching. This transformation is accomplished by building an artificial brain (a major component of which is plasmodial psyche) in which to incubate your new body, which you then essentially flay yourself into (probably not using the normal flay mind spell). Book has some flavor text comparing this to the goddess Athena, who was born fully-formed from Zeus' head.

The new body takes time (at least a couple hours) to mature, and attempting to transfer yourself prematurely will both kill you instantly and ruin the new body, restarting the wait.

The mind transfer spell requires enlightenment, and only works on the caster.

# Benefits

The most basic benefit is that your health bar becomes a far better media source, with it now being worth five times as much as normal (configurable).

Additionally, using idea inscription to read from/write to yourself (only yourself, not just "anyone who has undergone the transformation") becomes much cheaper, with writing now costing 1/4 of a dust and reading being free. 

The following benefits are a maybe, pending balance decisions and figuring out how the hell to code them:

- In addition to your health bar, your body becomes like a phial, which any casting capable of drawing from normal phials can access (at a lower priority than normal phials). Unlike your health bar, this media supply does not regenerate, but it can be recharged (not from your health).

- This media reservoir also acts as a defense mechanism, with a percentage of incoming damage being negated for a significant media cost (with the cost being logarithmic based on how much damage was negated after armor and such, to make it harder for things like railguns to just wipe out your entire supply). Additionally, if the reservoir's media is still above a certain threshold after a hit that would manage to kill you, it will consume all its remaining media to trigger a totem-like effect, both saving your life (along with providing regeneration and a second or two of resistance 5) and casting a pre-loaded hex which has access to that media but not any media from items you carry. However, if the hex consumes enough of that media to knock the reservoir below the critical threshold, you will not be saved from death.
