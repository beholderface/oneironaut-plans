# Lichdom
In all the myriad tales of sorcery that I've read, very few ideas are more common than a means to achieve immortality. From arcane rituals to bind one's soul to an object, to conceptual immunity to death, to ascending to divinity, this is surely a most lofty goal. *Surely* there must be a way to achieve this using the art of hex casting.

This has been a most interesting discovery. A realm of information, accessible from anywhere? Perhaps this supreme form of data transmission could be used to reach a semblance of immortality, by binding my mind to a proper receptacle and remotely piloting my no-longer-mortal body.

To achieve lichdom, you must cast a certain great spell to bind your mind to a multiblock structure in the noosphere. This structure uses multiple mindflayed components, and one of the blocks (not necessarily one of the mindflayed ones) is a socket which you put a solver hex into (as detailed in `puzzle.md`). The structure has a reservoir of media which is drained to fuel your resurrection.
