great spell that moves your cast environment to another dimension, along with a non-great spell that undoes it (for cheaper than it would cost to cast the first spell again)

no extra ambit is granted over the dimension, so you must use your sentinel (or ambit-providing things from other addons) in order to access anything

casting across dimensions causes a 20% media cost increase 

there is a non-great spell that moves your sentinel between dimensions, so that you can get it into your target dimension without needing something like a sentinel bed. can also be used to multiply sentinel walk efficiency by taking advantage of coordinate scaling.
