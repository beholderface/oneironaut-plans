# Rod Receptacle
A block that you can insert a reverberation rod into, and it will act like a static wisp casting the rod's hex. Can use rod patterns (plus one dedicated pattern to get the block's position, or maybe let it use Waystone Reflection), default ambit of 16 blocks from the receptacle. Casts as the player who placed it, limited to one active receptacle per player(not sure if things like Metronome Gambit should let you stagger castings). Can be toggled via redstone.

The block is linkable, and any iota it receives via link (except truenames) will be added to the stack of its next cast. Maybe have it also have a small amount of ambit around other linkables on the network it's on.
