# Rod Receptacle
A block that you can insert a reverberation rod into, and it will act like a static wisp casting the rod's hex. Can use rod patterns, default ambit of 16 blocks from the receptacle. Casts as the player who placed it, limited to one active receptacle per player(not sure if things like Metronome Gambit should let you stagger castings). Can be toggled via redstone.
