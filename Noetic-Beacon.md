# Noetic Beacon
A multiblock structure that consumes wisps to fuel itself, giving all players ambit in a 16-block radius centered on the capstone.

Can hold up to 200,000 dust worth of media, and eats any wisp that comes within a block of the siphon with 95% efficiency. Consumes 1 dust/second, must be in loaded chunks.

*Can* operate without power, but only produces a 1 block ambit radius, not large enough to reach the siphon's collection zone. You'll need to put your sentinel there in order to remotely refuel it, or GTP a wisp or something.

Captone is created by using Media Transfusion on a vanilla Beacon. Siphon is created by mind flaying something, and involves at least two echo shards. Everything else is crafted using normal recipes.

The siphon can also be used standalone, it attaches to an impetus and feeds it media from the siphon's reservoir at 50% efficiency. You can also place a sculk catalyst on it to slowly grow echo shards from the siphon's media.
