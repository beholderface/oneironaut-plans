# Noetic Beacon
A multiblock structure that consumes wisps to fuel itself, giving all players ambit in a 16-block radius centered on the capstone.

Can hold up to 200,000 dust worth of media, and eats any wisp that comes within a block of the siphon with 95% efficiency. Consumes 1 dust/second, must be in loaded chunks.

*Can* operate without power, but only produces a 1 block ambit radius, not large enough to reach the siphon's collection zone. You'll need to put your sentinel there in order to remotely refuel it, or GTP a wisp or something.
