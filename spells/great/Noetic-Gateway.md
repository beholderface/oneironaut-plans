# Noetic Gateway
Entity, NULL | Imprint ->

Consumes an entity and either a NULL or an Imprint. If given NULL, sends the target to their current coordinates in the noosphere if they arenâ€™t there already, or sends them to their respawn point if they are there. Non-players cannot be teleported without an imprint, instead it just mishaps. If given an imprint, sends the target to its current coordinates in the corresponding dimension. Costs 10 Charged Amethyst to enter the noosphere, 5 to leave it, and 25 to teleport directly from one non-noosphere dimension to another. Inflicts Blindness and Nausea for 10 seconds (2 seconds for other players).
