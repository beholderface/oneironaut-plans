# Media Transfusion
Vec ->

Instills finely-tuned media into a target block.

Turns slipways into a portal that can send you to the noosphere without having to cast Noetic Gateway. If there is no gate on the other side (like there would be with any natural slipway, barring generation glitches), one is created automatically. Slipways outside of the overworld cannot be converted in this way. While they no longer produce wandering wisps, the noosphere's free-wisp-upkeep effect extends in an eight-block radius around such gateways. This costs 20 Charged Amethyst.

It seems this can also be used on certain other blocks with chaotic media...

The following text is not in the book:

It can be used on inactive sculk shriekers to enable the can_summon blockstate, and turn beacons into the name-TBD capstone of the Noetic Beacon strucutre. Additionally, turns dead chorus flowers into fresh ones, cleanses wither skeleton skulls, wither roses into a random small flower, and soul blocks into their overworld counterparts.

Cost varies based on targeted block. Sculk shriekers and beacons cost 5 Charged, all the miscellaneous blocks cost one shard.
