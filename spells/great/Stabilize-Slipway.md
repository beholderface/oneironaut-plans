# Stabilize Slipway
Vec ->

Turns a slipway into a portal that can send you to the noosphere without having to cast Noetic Gateway. If there is no gate on the other side (like there would be with any natural slipway, barring generation glitches), one is created automatically. Does not work outside of the Overworld.

While it no longer produces wandering wisps, the noosphere's free-wisp-upkeep effect extends in an eight-block radius around the gateway.
